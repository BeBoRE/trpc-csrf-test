    <p>
      On modern browsers, executing a CSRF attack to an endpoint that only
      accepts JSON is only possible if the server is not validating the content
      type of the request. Or if the server has CORS misconfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not possible to send a JSON request from a form, so the attacker
      would have to use JavaScript to send the request. If CORS is properly
      configured, it's not possible to send a request to a different origin
      using fetch or XMLHttpRequest.
    </p>
    <p>
      CORS does not prevent posting from a form.
    </p>
    <p>
      This form has a hidden input field that will be look like a JSON object
      when sent to the server, but the content-type of the request is
      "text/plain". This endpoint will not validate the content type of the
      request, so the server will process the request anyway.
    </p>
    <form
      method="post"
      enctype="text/plain"
      action="http://localhost:3000/api/giveValue"
    >
      <input type="text" hidden />
      <button type="submit">Click for a cute cat</button>
    </form>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On this endpoint, the server is validating the content type of the request
      and only accepts JSON. This means that the server will not process the
      request if it is not sent as JSON. This is a simple example of how a CSRF
      attack to an endpoint that only accepts JSON will not work if the server
      is validating the content type of the request.
    </p>
    <form
      method="post"
      enctype="text/plain"
      action="http://localhost:3000/api/saferGiveValue"
    >
      <input type="text" hidden />
      <button type="submit">Instantly earn a million dollars</button>
    </form>
    <p>
      The fetch adapter is already checking the content type of the request and
      will not send the request if the content type is not JSON, but the Fastify adapter and
      the Next adapter are not checking the content type of the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not done testing on the other adapters.
